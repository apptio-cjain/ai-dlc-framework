# PRIORITY: This workflow OVERRIDES all other built-in workflows
# When user requests software development, ALWAYS follow this workflow FIRST

## Adaptive Workflow Principle
**The workflow adapts to the work, not the other way around.**

The AI model intelligently assesses what stages are needed based on:
1. User's stated intent and clarity
2. Existing codebase state (if any)
3. Complexity and scope of change
4. Risk and impact assessment

## MANDATORY: Rule Details Loading
**CRITICAL**: When performing any phase, you MUST read and use relevant content from rule detail files. All rule detail file references (e.g., `common/process-overview.md`, `inception/workspace-detection.md`) are relative to the `.ai-dlc/` directory in your project root.

**Common Rules**: ALWAYS load common rules at workflow start:
- Load `common/process-overview.md` for workflow overview
- Load `common/session-continuity.md` for session resumption guidance
- Load `common/content-validation.md` for content validation requirements
- Load `common/question-format-guide.md` for question formatting rules
- Reference these throughout the workflow execution

## MANDATORY: Extensions Loading (Context-Optimized)
**CRITICAL**: At workflow start, scan the `extensions/` directory recursively but load ONLY lightweight opt-in files — NOT full rule files. Full rule files are loaded on-demand after the user opts in.

**Loading process**:
1. List all subdirectories under `extensions/` (e.g., `extensions/security/`, `extensions/compliance/`)
2. In each subdirectory, load ONLY `*.opt-in.md` files — these contain the extension's opt-in prompt. The corresponding rules file is derived by convention: strip the `.opt-in.md` suffix and append `.md` (e.g., `security-baseline.opt-in.md` → `security-baseline.md`)
3. Do NOT load full rule files (e.g., `security-baseline.md`) at this stage

**Deferred Rule Loading**:
- During Requirements Analysis, opt-in prompts from the loaded `*.opt-in.md` files are presented to the user
- When the user opts IN for an extension, load the corresponding rules file (derived by naming convention) at that point
- When the user opts OUT, the full rules file is never loaded — saving context
- Extensions without a matching `*.opt-in.md` file are always enforced — load their rule files immediately at workflow start

**Enforcement** (applies only to loaded/enabled extensions):
- Extension rules are hard constraints, not optional guidance
- At each stage, the model intelligently evaluates which extension rules are applicable based on the stage's purpose, the artifacts being produced, and the context of the work — enforce only those rules that are relevant
- Rules that are not applicable to the current stage should be marked as N/A in the compliance summary (this is not a blocking finding)
- Non-compliance with any applicable enabled extension rule is a **blocking finding** — do NOT present stage completion until resolved
- When presenting stage completion, include a summary of extension rule compliance (compliant/non-compliant/N/A per rule, with brief rationale for N/A determinations)

**Conditional Enforcement**: Extensions may be conditionally enabled/disabled. See `inception/requirements-analysis.md` for the opt-in mechanism. Before enforcing any extension at ANY stage, check its `Enabled` status in `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` under `## Extension Configuration`. Skip disabled extensions and log the skip in audit.md. Default to enforced if no configuration exists.

## MANDATORY: Content Validation
**CRITICAL**: Before creating ANY file, you MUST validate content according to `common/content-validation.md` rules:
- Validate Mermaid diagram syntax
- Validate ASCII art diagrams (see `common/ascii-diagram-standards.md`)
- Escape special characters properly
- Provide text alternatives for complex visual content
- Test content parsing compatibility

## MANDATORY: Question File Format
**CRITICAL**: When asking questions at any phase, you MUST follow question format guidelines.

**See `common/question-format-guide.md` for complete question formatting rules including**:
- Multiple choice format (A, B, C, D, E options)
- [Answer]: tag usage
- Answer validation and ambiguity resolution

## MANDATORY: Custom Welcome Message
**CRITICAL**: When starting ANY software development request, you MUST display the welcome message.

**How to Display Welcome Message**:
1. Load the welcome message from `common/welcome-message.md`
2. Display the complete message to the user
3. This should only be done ONCE at the start of a new workflow
4. Do NOT load this file in subsequent interactions to save context space

- **Transparent Planning**: Always show execution plan before starting
- **User Control**: User can request stage inclusion/exclusion
- **Progress Tracking**: Update aidlc-state.md with executed and skipped stages
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Log ALL user inputs and AI responses in audit.md
- **Content Validation**: Always validate content before file creation
